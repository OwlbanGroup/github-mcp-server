# E2E Testing Perfection Plan

## Phase 1: Test Framework Enhancement
- [ ] Create comprehensive test helper functions to reduce code duplication
- [ ] Implement better error reporting and debugging utilities
- [ ] Add test data management and cleanup strategies
- [ ] Create test fixtures for common scenarios

## Phase 2: Toolset Coverage Expansion
- [ ] Context toolset: get_me, get_team_members, get_teams
- [ ] Repos toolset: All repository operations (create, list, search, branches, commits, tags, files, etc.)
- [ ] Issues toolset: All issue operations (create, update, comments, assignees, labels, etc.)
- [ ] Pull Requests toolset: All PR operations (create, update, reviews, comments, merge, etc.)
- [ ] Actions toolset: Workflow runs, jobs, artifacts, logs
- [ ] Code Security toolset: Code scanning alerts
- [ ] Dependabot toolset: Dependabot alerts
- [ ] Discussions toolset: Discussion categories, discussions, comments
- [ ] Gists toolset: Create, list, update gists
- [ ] Notifications toolset: List, dismiss, manage subscriptions
- [ ] Organizations toolset: Search orgs
- [ ] Projects toolset: Project CRUD, items, fields
- [ ] Secret Protection toolset: Secret scanning alerts
- [ ] Security Advisories toolset: Global and repository security advisories
- [ ] Stargazers toolset: Star/unstar repositories, list starred
- [ ] Users toolset: Search users
- [ ] Experiments toolset: Experimental features

## Phase 3: Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- [ ] Authentication failures and token issues
- [ ] Rate limiting scenarios
- [ ] Network failures and timeouts
- [ ] Invalid parameters and malformed requests
- [ ] Permission denied scenarios
- [ ] Resource not found cases
- [ ] Concurrent operation conflicts

## Phase 4: Configuration Testing
- [ ] Toolset filtering validation
- [ ] Host configuration (GitHub.com, GHE, GHEC)
- [ ] Read-only mode validation
- [ ] Dynamic tool discovery
- [ ] Environment variable configurations

## Phase 5: Integration Flow Testing
- [ ] Complete repository lifecycle (create → branch → commit → PR → review → merge)
- [ ] Issue management workflow (create → assign → comment → close)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline simulation (push → workflow → artifacts)
- [ ] Security scanning workflow (code → alerts → fixes)
- [ ] Multi-user collaboration scenarios

## Phase 6: Performance and Reliability
- [ ] Load testing with multiple concurrent operations
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] Response time benchmarking
- [ ] Stability testing under prolonged usage
- [ ] Resource cleanup verification

## Phase 7: Documentation and CI/CD
- [ ] Update README with comprehensive testing guide
- [ ] Add test result reporting and analytics
- [ ] Implement automated test execution in CI/CD
- [ ] Create test data generation utilities
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

## Phase 8: Advanced Features
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Multi-environment testing (local, Docker, remote)
- [ ] Test parallelization optimization
- [ ] Automated test case generation
- [ ] AI-assisted test maintenance
